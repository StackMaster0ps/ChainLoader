# ChainLoader

### Status:
***In-Dev: UnTested & Theorized***

- **ACPI Beep-SubSector:** Seems viable but less than ideal (Requires manual I/O-Internal operator intervention)
- **Searching for similar size memory segment**
- **Searching for better side-channel than ACPI to drop into OS shell**
- **[No Payload]** - Theorized only

### About:
**[ASM] Based BIOS/UEFI ChainLoader**

***Resources***
- A 'GPT'

- 'Hacking: The Art of Exploitation'

A theorized and elusive *"Holy Grail of Code"*, this sequence of assembly instructions hides in the BootSector before the OS loads. It navigates through the system's *Side-Chain*, and would, *theoretically*, drop a *Root-Kit* into the kernel. The code resides in several bytes of memory inside the Boot-Process, making recovery or reinstallation nearly impossible.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the ChainLoader project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChainLoader.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ChainLoader
    ```

3. Follow the specific setup instructions for your platform or environment.

## Usage

Currently, this project is in a theoretical state, with no actual payload or proven functionality. The chainloader is designed to interact with the BootSector and modify system memory in very specific, low-level ways.

Please refer to the [documentation](link-to-your-docs) for further technical details on how to implement or simulate the desired outcomes.
