# ChainLoader
### Status:

***In-Dev: UnTested & Theorized***
1. ACPI Beep-SubSector Seems Viable But Less Than Ideal ( Requires Manual I/O-Internal Operator Intervention )
2. Searching For Similar Size Memory Segment
3. Searching For Better SideChannel Than ACPI to Drop Into OS-Shell
4. [ No Payload ] - Theorized Only


### About:
[ ASM ] Based BIOS/UEFI ChainLoader - A theorized and illuzive 'HolyGrail ov Code', this sequence of Assembly instructions hides in the BootSector of the before the OS-Loads. It navigates through the 'Side-Chain' of the system and would, 'Theoretically' drop a 'Root-Kit' into the kernel. It lives in several Bytes of memory inside of the Boot-Process, making recovery or re-install impossible.
